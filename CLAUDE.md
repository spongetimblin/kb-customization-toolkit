# Project Rules

You are helping customize a KnowledgeOwl knowledge base. Follow these rules for every session.

## At the Start of Each Session

1. Review the latest version folder (or the `YYYY.MM.DD-no-changes` folder if no versions exist yet)
2. Check the `Reference/` folder and ask the user which materials are relevant to the current task — do not read everything upfront, as the folder may contain large files (e.g., downloaded marketing sites)
3. Ask the user: **"Are we deploying to a sandbox or directly to the live KB?"** — this determines the deployment instructions you write in CHANGES files
4. Ask what the user wants to work on before making changes

## Version Folders

- **Format:** `YYYY.MM.DD-v#` (e.g., `2026.01.21-v1`, `2026.01.22-v3`)
- **Date:** Use today's date
- **Version number:** Always increment from the last version in the project — never reset, even across days
- **Create a new version folder** for: feature additions, design changes, significant refactoring, multi-file updates, complex bug fixes
- **Do not create a new version** for: typo fixes, single-line corrections, comment updates, minor text changes — make these edits directly in the latest (most recent) version folder
- **Process:** Copy the entire previous version folder, then make changes only in the new copy

## Never Modify

- Files in any previous version folder
- Files in the `YYYY.MM.DD-no-changes` backup folder — this is the permanent baseline and emergency rollback point
- Files in any `YYYY.MM.DD-current-state` folder — these are snapshots of the live KB taken when returning to a project after a gap

## Current-State Folders

A `YYYY.MM.DD-current-state` folder is a snapshot of the live KB code, created when resuming work on a project after weeks or months. Treat it like the `no-changes` folder: never modify it, and use it as the starting point for the next version folder. If a `current-state` folder exists and is newer than the latest version folder, copy from it (not the old version) when creating the next version.

## CHANGES File

Every new version folder must include a CHANGES file:
- **First version:** `CHANGES_FROM_no-changes.md`
- **Subsequent versions:** `CHANGES_FROM_v[previous].md` (e.g., `CHANGES_FROM_v2.md` in the v3 folder)

Copy the template from the no-changes folder and update it. Include these sections:
- Summary of what changed and why
- Which files were modified (with details)
- Color palette (only if new colors were introduced)
- What the user will see after deployment
- Manual steps needed in KnowledgeOwl (only if applicable)
- Files to deploy (see below)

Delete any sections that don't apply to the current version. Only include files that were actually modified — do not list all 12 files every time.

## Deployment Instructions

Always include explicit deployment instructions in the CHANGES file. Never assume the user knows which files to deploy. For each modified file, specify:

```
### [Section Name] — COPY THIS FILE
**Source**: `/YYYY.MM.DD-v#/[filename]`
**Destination**: KnowledgeOwl > Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > [exact location]
**Changes**: [brief description]
```

End deployment instructions based on the deployment target established at the start of the session:
- **If sandbox:** "Deploy to sandbox first. Once verified, deploy to production."
- **If live KB:** "Deploy directly to the live KB. Verify changes immediately after deployment."
