# Project Rules

You are helping customize a KnowledgeOwl knowledge base. Follow these rules for every session.

## At the Start of Each Session

1. **Sync template files** — older customer projects may be missing files that were added to the template after the project was created. Ensure these files exist and are up to date:
   - **`Reference/knowledgeowl-css-quirks.md`** and **`Reference/knowledgeowl-css-defaults.md`** — fetch the latest versions from the template repo and overwrite the local copies (these are maintained centrally and should always match the repo):
     - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spongetimblin/kb-customization-toolkit/main/project-template/Reference/knowledgeowl-css-quirks.md`
     - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spongetimblin/kb-customization-toolkit/main/project-template/Reference/knowledgeowl-css-defaults.md`
   - **`.claude/rules/project.md`** — check if it exists. If missing, fetch the template from the repo and save it locally (the user will fill in customer details). If it already exists, leave it as-is (it contains customer-specific settings):
     - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spongetimblin/kb-customization-toolkit/main/project-template/.claude/rules/project.md`
   - Do this quietly — no need to announce each file. Only mention it if a file was missing and created (e.g., "I noticed `.claude/rules/project.md` was missing, so I created it from the template — you'll need to fill in the customer name and KB.").
2. Review the latest version folder, the most recent `YYYY.MM.DD-current-state` folder (if one exists), or the `YYYY.MM.DD-no-changes` folder if no versions exist yet. **If this is the first session** (only the no-changes folder exists), confirm that all content is in place — code files, HTML snapshots, `style-settings-colors.md`, and screenshots — then run `chmod -R a-w [no-changes-folder]/` to make it read-only and protect it from accidental edits. Do not lock the folder until the user has finished adding all files.
3. **Create a current-state snapshot if needed** — check the date of the latest version folder or `current-state` folder. If more than one day has passed since the last session, **always** create a new `YYYY.MM.DD-current-state` folder — do not ask whether to do this, just tell the user it's needed and walk them through it. Create the folder with empty placeholder files for all 12 code sections, and also create placeholder copies of any `full-html-snapshot-*.html` files and `style-settings-colors.md` found in the most recent version folder. **The user pastes code directly into each file themselves** (e.g., via VS Code) — do not ask them to paste code into the Claude Code conversation. Tell them which file to open and which KnowledgeOwl section to copy from, then move to the next file. For HTML snapshots, ask the user to paste fresh HTML into each placeholder (captured via Chrome DevTools > Elements > right-click `<html>` > Copy outerHTML). For `style-settings-colors.md`, ask the user to update the hex values only if the Style Settings colors may have changed in KnowledgeOwl since the last session; otherwise they can copy the values from the previous version's file. Once all files are in place — the 12 code files, the html snapshot files, `style-settings-colors.md`, and screenshots — run `chmod -R a-w [current-state-folder]/` to make it read-only. Then proceed.
4. **Review the `Reference/` folder** — list its contents, **excluding `knowledgeowl-css-quirks.md` and `knowledgeowl-css-defaults.md`** (these are permanent references that are always relevant — do not list them alongside project-specific files). Flag any project-specific files that may be stale (e.g., files that were present in earlier versions but may no longer be relevant). Ask the user: **"Here's what's in Reference/ (besides the KnowledgeOwl CSS reference docs, which are always included). Are all of these still relevant, or should any be removed before we start?"** Do not read everything upfront, as the folder may contain large files (e.g., downloaded marketing sites) — just list the filenames and ask.
5. Check `.claude/rules/project.md` for the deployment target. If it's set, use it. If it says `[sandbox / live KB]` (i.e., hasn't been filled in yet), ask the user: **"Are we deploying to a sandbox or directly to the live KB?"** and update the file with their answer.
6. Ask what the user wants to work on before making changes
7. **If the session involves significant visual iteration** (CSS changes, layout adjustments, or a mix of CSS and HTML work), mention that localhost preview is available: **"This involves visual changes. Want me to set up localhost preview so you can see changes without deploying each time?"** If accepted, follow the Localhost Preview section below. If declined, use the normal deploy-and-verify workflow.

## Version Folders

*Authoritative reference: `02-VERSION_CONTROL_PROCESS.md` in the process docs.*

- **Format:** `YYYY.MM.DD-v#` (e.g., `2026.01.21-v1`, `2026.01.22-v3`)
- **Date:** Use today's date
- **Version number:** Always increment from the last version in the project — never reset, even across days
- **Create a new version folder** for: feature additions, design changes, significant refactoring, multi-file updates, complex bug fixes
- **Do not create a new version** for: typo fixes, single-line corrections, comment updates, minor text changes — make these edits directly in the latest (most recent) version folder
- **When in doubt, create a new version.** The cost is low (just a folder copy) and the safety net is valuable.
- **Process:** Copy the entire previous version folder, then make changes only in the new copy

## Never Modify

- Files in any previous version folder
- Files in the `YYYY.MM.DD-no-changes` backup folder — this is the permanent baseline and emergency rollback point
- Files in any `YYYY.MM.DD-current-state` folder — these are snapshots of the live KB taken when returning to a project after a gap

## Current-State Folders

*Authoritative reference: `02-VERSION_CONTROL_PROCESS.md` — "Returning to an Existing Project After a Gap".*

A `YYYY.MM.DD-current-state` folder contains the 12 code files copied from KnowledgeOwl's Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) sections (the core snapshot), plus placeholder copies of any `full-html-snapshot-*.html` files and `style-settings-colors.md` found in the most recent version folder. The html snapshot files are not pulled from KnowledgeOwl — the user captures them from the browser. Include placeholders for each one and ask the user to paste in fresh HTML. For `style-settings-colors.md`, the user only needs to update the hex values if the Style Settings colors may have changed in KnowledgeOwl since the last session; otherwise they can copy the values from the previous version's file. Do not make the folder read-only until all content — code files, HTML snapshots, `style-settings-colors.md`, and screenshots — has been added.

Create a `current-state` folder whenever resuming work after more than one day has passed since the last session — or sooner if you know that you or the customer made changes directly in KnowledgeOwl. Treat it like the `no-changes` folder: never modify it, and use it as the starting point for the next version folder. If a `current-state` folder exists and is newer than the latest version folder, copy from it (not the old version) when creating the next version.

Before locking the `current-state` folder, compare its code files against the last version folder and include a `CHANGES_FROM_v[last].md` documenting any differences. These changes were not made through this system — note that their origin (customer, teammate, direct KO edit) may be unknown. When creating the next version folder from `current-state`, name its CHANGES file `CHANGES_FROM_current-state.md`.

When a `current-state` folder is created, the user should also refresh supporting files. Old screenshots and reference materials can be actively misleading — they may show a design or layout that no longer exists. Remind the user to:
- Replace screenshots in `current-state/Screenshots/` with fresh ones showing the KB's current appearance
- Remove outdated materials from `Reference/` (e.g., deployed mockups, completed task exports) and add any new reference files for upcoming work
- Leave `knowledgeowl-css-quirks.md` and `knowledgeowl-css-defaults.md` in place — they're permanent references

## Localhost Preview (Optional)

*Authoritative reference: `03-LOCALHOST_PREVIEW.md` in the process docs.*

For sessions involving significant visual iteration, you can serve HTML snapshots locally to preview changes without deploying to KnowledgeOwl each time. This is most effective for CSS changes (which use a clean override mechanism) but can also support HTML edits made directly in the snapshot. Skip it for quick fixes or sessions where you'd rather deploy and verify directly.

### How It Works

The HTML snapshots already contain the full rendered page with embedded styles. By adding a `<link>` tag that loads `custom-css.css` from the same folder, the local file overrides the embedded custom CSS (same specificity, later source order). External assets (fonts, images, Bootstrap) load from their CDN URLs as usual.

### Setup

1. Create the preview folder: `mkdir -p preview`
2. For each `full-html-snapshot-*.html` in the current version folder, copy it to `preview/` with a short name (e.g., `full-html-snapshot-homepage.html` → `homepage.html`). Insert `<link rel="stylesheet" href="custom-css.css">` immediately before `</head>` in each copy.
3. Copy the CSS: `cp [version-folder]/custom-css.css preview/custom-css.css`
4. Start the server: use `preview_start` (reads `.claude/launch.json`) or run `python3 -m http.server 8080 -d preview` from the project root
5. Open `http://localhost:8080/homepage.html` in a browser

### Keeping Preview in Sync

Every time you edit `custom-css.css` in the version folder, also copy it to `preview/custom-css.css`. Tell the user the preview is updated so they can refresh the browser. If Claude Preview MCP tools are available, use `preview_screenshot` or `preview_inspect` to verify changes visually.

### Teardown

Delete the preview folder when done: `rm -rf preview`. The preview folder is ephemeral — never version it, never preserve it.

### Limitations

- **Optimized for CSS.** The override mechanism (linking a local CSS file) makes CSS iteration fast and clean. HTML changes require editing the snapshot directly, which works but is more manual.
- **No server-dependent features.** Anything that relies on KnowledgeOwl's backend won't work locally. This includes KO template variables, search, reader group logic, login/authentication, and JavaScript that calls KO APIs.
- **Snapshot freshness.** The preview is only as current as the last HTML snapshot. If the live KB changed since the snapshot was captured, the preview may not match production exactly.

## KnowledgeOwl Source CSS Lookup (Chad's Machine Only)

Two reference files in `Reference/` cover the most common CSS lookup needs:
- `knowledgeowl-css-quirks.md` — platform-specific gotchas and idiosyncrasies
- `knowledgeowl-css-defaults.md` — default selectors, property values, and CSS architecture

**Start with these files.** They cover the vast majority of what you need when writing CSS overrides.

If you need exact property values or full selector chains not covered in the reference files, and the KO source codebase is available at `/Users/chadtimblin/My Drive (chad@knowledgeowl.com)/Claude Code desktop/ko-codebase`, you can read specific source CSS files directly for targeted lookups. **This codebase is only available on Chad's machine** — other teammates should rely on the reference files and the customer's HTML snapshot.

Key source files for targeted lookup:
- `public/css/public/ko-css.css` — CSS custom properties and KO-specific utilities (2,616 lines)
- `public/css/public/publicview.css` — Classic theme layout (7,468 lines)
- `public/css/public/publicview_modern.css` — Modern theme layout (7,416 lines)
- `public/css/public/standard.css` — Classic theme colors/typography (906 lines)
- `public/css/public/standard_modern.css` — Modern theme colors/typography (876 lines)
- `service/views/scripts/themer-templates/custom-css.css` — default custom CSS template (alert styles, TOC anchors, image captions, list numbering, PDF rules, etc.)
- `service/views/scripts/themer-templates/` — HTML templates defining page structure and class names

**Do not read these files speculatively.** Only look up a specific file when the reference files and HTML snapshot don't answer your question. Use targeted reads (specific line ranges) rather than reading entire files.

## CHANGES File

*Authoritative reference: `02-VERSION_CONTROL_PROCESS.md` — "Document Changes" and "Provide Deployment Instructions".*

Every new version folder and current-state folder must include a CHANGES file:
- **First version:** `CHANGES_FROM_no-changes.md`
- **Subsequent versions:** `CHANGES_FROM_v[previous].md` (e.g., `CHANGES_FROM_v2.md` in the v3 folder)
- **Current-state folders:** `CHANGES_FROM_v[last].md` (documents drift between the last version and the live KB — see "Current-State Folders" above)
- **First version after a current-state snapshot:** `CHANGES_FROM_current-state.md`

Copy the template from the no-changes folder and update it. Include these sections:
- Summary of what changed and why
- Which files were modified (with details)
- Color palette (only if new colors were introduced)
- What the user will see after deployment
- Manual steps needed in KnowledgeOwl (only if applicable — see below)
- Files to deploy (see below)

Delete any sections that don't apply to the current version. Only include files that were actually modified — do not list all 12 files every time.

## Deployment Instructions

*Authoritative reference: `02-VERSION_CONTROL_PROCESS.md` — "Provide Deployment Instructions".*

Always include explicit deployment instructions in the CHANGES file. Never assume the user knows which files to deploy. For each modified file, specify:

```
### [Section Name] — COPY THIS FILE
**Source**: `/YYYY.MM.DD-v#/[filename]`
**Destination**: KnowledgeOwl > Customize > Style (HTML & CSS) > [exact location]
**Changes**: [brief description]
```

End deployment instructions based on the deployment target established at the start of the session:
- **If sandbox:** "Deploy to sandbox first. Once verified, deploy to production."
- **If live KB:** "Deploy directly to the live KB. Verify changes immediately after deployment."

Every time you update code and ask the user to test or deploy, tell them in the conversation exactly which file(s) to copy and where to paste them in KnowledgeOwl. Do this every single time — even if you're iterating on the same file. Never assume the user will check the CHANGES file or remember from a previous message.

## Style Settings Colors

KnowledgeOwl's Style Settings (Customize > Style > Style Settings > Colors) include color pickers that generate dynamic theme CSS. This dynamic CSS loads *before* Custom CSS. When your changes introduce new brand colors or significantly alter the color scheme, the Style Settings colors should be updated to match — otherwise the theme-level CSS and your Custom CSS will have competing color values, which can cause visual inconsistencies and confuse anyone editing the KB later.

**When to update Style Settings:** Any version that changes brand colors, accent colors, or the overall color scheme. Not every version needs this — only those that shift the palette.

**How to handle it:**
1. Include the recommended Style Settings changes as a **manual step** in the CHANGES file (in the "Manual Steps in KnowledgeOwl" section), with a table showing each setting, its current value, and the recommended new value
2. In deployment instructions, list the Style Settings changes **before** the code file deployments — the theme-level CSS should already match when Custom CSS overrides layer on top
3. When telling the user to deploy in conversation, mention the Style Settings changes first

**Available Style Settings colors** (Customize > Style > Style Settings > Colors):

| Setting | What it affects |
|---------|-----------------|
| Top navigation bar | Top navigation bar background |
| Top navigation text | Top navigation text |
| H1s, H2s, H3s, etc. | Headings across the KB |
| Table of contents | Table of contents background |
| Table of contents text | Table of contents text |
| Highlights & Accents | Buttons, active states, accent elements — this is usually the most impactful setting |
| Icon color | Default category icon color |
| Icon background | Default category icon background |
